# Gocord

Gocord is a Go library forked from [DisGo](https://github.com/disgoorg/disgo),
that is a Discord API wrapper written in Go.

> **Why fork?:** This project was created for internal use within the bot
> [Digo](https://github.com/nextep-community/digo), which was developed by
> Nextep to study and enhance the team's knowledge of Go. For this reason, we
> wanted maximum control and to ensure the library is updated as quickly as
> possible with the latest Discord changes. However, we didnâ€™t want to start
> from scratch.

### Stability

The public API of Gocord is mostly stable at this point in time. Smaller
breaking changes can happen before the v1 is released.

After v1 is released breaking changes may only happen if the Discord API
requires them. They tend to break their released API versions now and then. In
general for every new Discord API version the major version of Gocord should be
increased and with that breaking changes between non-major versions should be
held to a minimum.

## Getting Started

### Installing

```sh
$ go get github.com/nextep-community/gocord
```

### Building a gocord Instance

Build a bot client to interact with the Discord API

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"os"
	"os/signal"
	"syscall"

	"github.com/nextep-community/gocord"
	"github.com/nextep-community/gocord/bot"
	"github.com/nextep-community/gocord/events"
	"github.com/nextep-community/gocord/gateway"
)

func main() {
	client, err := gocord.New("token",
		// set gateway options
		bot.WithGatewayConfigOpts(
			// set enabled intents
			gateway.WithIntents(
				gateway.IntentGuilds,
				gateway.IntentGuildMessages,
				gateway.IntentDirectMessages,
			),
		),
		// add event listeners
		bot.WithEventListenerFunc(func(e *events.MessageCreate) {
			// event code here
		}),
	)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	// connect to the gateway
	if err = client.OpenGateway(context.TODO()); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	s := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
	signal.Notify(s, syscall.SIGINT, syscall.SIGTERM)
	<-s
}
```
